## ðŸ“Œintroduce
CCPC is the first  PCL dataset in the Chinese field, with over 14k hierarchical annotation data targeting vulnerable groups on the Weibo and Zhihu platforms.<br />

PCL(Patronizing and Condescending Language) is a form of implicitly toxic speech aimed at vulnerable groups with the potential to cause them long-term harm. **_Please note that PCL comments may be offensive and cause discomfort!_**

CCPC_test_10k_1.0.csv is a case document with 5k PCL data, and the final dataset (with a scale of 14k) will be available soon. At that time, the baseline results in the study (with a scale of 11k in the publication) will be updated.
